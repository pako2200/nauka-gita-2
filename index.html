            <h3>by Creedence Clearwater Revival</h3>
            <pre>
                Someone told me long ago
                There's a calm before the storm
                I know it's been comin' for some time
                When it's over so they say
                It'll rain a sunny day
                I know shinin' down like water
                
                I want to know
                Have you ever seen the rain?
                I want to know
                Have you ever seen the rain
                Comin' down on a sunny day?
                
                Yesterday and days before
                Sun is cold and rain is hard    
                I know been that way for all my time
                'Til forever, on it goes
                Through the circle, fast and slow,
                I know it can't stop, I wonder
                
                I want to know
                Have you ever seen the rain?
                I want to know
                Have you ever seen the rain
                Comin' down on a sunny day?
                
                Yeah    
                
                I want to know
                Have you ever seen the rain?    
                I want to know
                Have you ever seen the rain
                Comin' down on a sunny day?
